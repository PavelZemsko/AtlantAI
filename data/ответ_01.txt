Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. Can you tell me a little bit about your cooking habits?

Interviewee: Of course! I try to cook most of my meals at home, partly to save money and partly to control my diet.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. How do you decide what to cook?

Interviewee: I usually plan my meals out for the week on Sundays. I try to include a mix of different proteins and vegetables, and I always make sure to have plenty of healthy options on hand.

Interviewer: That's a smart approach. How often do you cook at home?

Interviewee: I would say I cook about 5-6 nights a week. I try to make enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day too.

Interviewer: That's impressive! What do you like about cooking at home?

Interviewee: I like being able to control what goes into my meals, and I find cooking to be a relaxing activity after a long day at work.

Interviewer: That's understandable. What frustrates you when you cook at home?
